# MHW Archipelago
A Monster Hunter World Randomizer Mod with implementation with [the Multi-Game Multi-World randomizer system Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg).

## What is Archipelago and how does it differ from other randomizers?
Basically Archipelago is a system that allows everyone to bring a game of their choice (as long as it is supported) and have them all blended together into one big fun cooperative multiplayer experience.

An example of this is as follows. Let's say I am playing Monster Hunter World and my friend is playing Hollow Knight. I end up completing one of my quests in World getting my friend his Mothwing Cloak. This allows him to go to new areas eventually getting me a weapon upgrade. This allows me to take on harder quests in order to get new items for the both of us. This continues until we both end up finishing our games.
