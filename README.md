# MHW Archipelago
A Monster Hunter World Randomizer Mod with implementation with [the Multi-Game Multi-World randomizer system Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg).

## What is Archipelago and how does it differ from other randomizers?
Basically Archipelago is a system that allows everyone to bring a game of their choice (as long as it is supported) and have them all blended together into one big fun cooperative multiplayer experience.

An example of this is as follows. Let's say I am playing Monster Hunter World and my friend is playing Hollow Knight. I end up completing one of my quests in World getting my friend his Mothwing Cloak. This allows him to go to new areas eventually getting me a weapon upgrade. This allows me to take on harder quests in order to get new items for the both of us. This continues until we both end up finishing our games.

## What the Mod Changes
This mod is still in very early alpha (as of September 2025) so many features I want to add haven't been implemented. This has a 4 year long project learning basically from scratch so this is only the beginning.

* There are 3 win conditions (More May Be Added Later):
  *   Low Rank: Complete Invader In The Waste.
  *   High Rank: Complete Land of Convergence.
  *   Master Rank: Complete Paean of Guidance.
* Weapons and Armors have been overhauled to be progressive items to allow unique game progression.
* Endemic Life, most Quests, and Specialized Tools have been added as locations and/or items. More to come.
* Loot Boxes have been added as an interesting filler item.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Have Monster Hunter World installed ver(15.23.00).
  * Note: The mod has been designed with Iceborne in mind. It may not work correctly without it especially with incorrect settings. Following updates will address this.
* Install [Stacker's Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/1982) and [Performace Booster and Plugin Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/3473). Both are required for the mod to run properly.
* Install the latest Archipelago tools from [Archipelago's GitHub Release's Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases). Run the setup.
* Go to the releases page of this repo. If you are the one running Monster Hunter World you will only need to download the .zip.
